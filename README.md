# Bitmap Challenge

## Task

There is given a rectangular bitmap of size n\*m. Each pixel of the bitmap is either white or black, but at least one is white. The pixel in i-th line and j-th column is called the pixel (i,j). The distance between two pixels p1=(i1,j1) and p2=(i2,j2) is defined as d(p1,p2)=|i1-i2|+|j1-j2|.

Write a program which:

- Reads the description of the bitmap from the standard input.
- For each pixel, computes the distance to the nearest white.
- writes the results to the standard output.

### Input

- The number of test cases t (1≤t≤1000) is in the first line of input.
- Then t test cases follow separated by an empty line.
- In the first line of each test case there is a pair of integer numbers n, m separated by a single space, 1<=n <=182, 1<=m<=182.
- In each of the following n lines of the test case exactly one zero-one word of length m, the description of one line of the bitmap, is written.
- On the j-th position in the line (i+1), 1 <= i <= n, 1 <= j <= m, is '1' if, and only if the pixel (i,j) is white.

```

## Usage

### Running the code

1. Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

1. Sample  [input.txt](input.txt) is provided or use the default above.

2. Run the code that'll invoke all methods and test cases, thus printing the output  

```
yarn start
```

### Running the test cases

```
yarn test
```
